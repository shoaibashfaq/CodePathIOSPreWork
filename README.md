# Prework - Code Path IOS PreWork

Submitted by: Muhammed Ashfaq

Code Path IOS PreWork is an app that shows my basic information and upon clicking a button arbitrarily changes the background color.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. **Reddit**
      - The longform (unlike twitter) content is intrigiuing and fun to read.
      - The anonymous nature of the users allows for authentic and unfiltered discussions to take place. 
2. **Instagram**
      - Reels: I find the content short and amusing
      - Photography: Instagram is sepcifically tailored for photography.
3. **Snapchat**
      - Live Location: Really interesting to see where my family and friends are and what they're up to.
      - Snap Streaks: Wholesome streaks keep me updated about my friends and family. Its fun to compete on who has the longest streaks.

## My App Idea
A unbiqutoius problem in Masjids (the Muslim place to pray), is that worshippers often forget to mute their phones. This forgetfullness distrurbs the congregation when praying. I am thinking of creating an application that uses geoinformation to automatically mute phones or set them to vibaration once they enter the premisies of the masjid. This application will also include basic Muslim prayer information.
