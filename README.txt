## App BrainStorming


1. Reddit
      - The longform (unlike twitter) content is intrigiuing and fun to read.
      - The anonymous nature of the users allows for authentic and unfiltered discussions to take place. 
2. Instagram: 
      - Reels: I find the content short and amusing
      - Photography: Instagram is sepcifically tailored for photography.
3. Snapchat
      - Live Location: Really interesting to see where my family and friends are and what they're up to.
      - Snap Streaks: Wholesome streaks keeps me updated about my friends and family. Its fun to compete on who has the longest streaks.

## My App Idea
A unbiqutoius problem in Masjids (the Muslim area to pray), is that worshippers often forget to mute their phones. This forgetfullness distrurbs the congregation when praying. I am thinking of creating an application that uses geoinformation to automatically mute phones or set them to vibaration once they enter the premisies of the masjid. This application will also include basic Muslim prayer information.
